**Project Overview**

The Smart Beekeeping Project is designed to help beekeepers monitor and manage their beehives using IoT technology. This system integrates various sensors to collect data on hive conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and bee activity, and uses this data to provide insights and alerts to the beekeeper.

**Features**

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitor hive temperature, humidity, and bee activity.
Data Logging: Record data over time for analysis.
Alerts: Receive alerts for significant changes or dangerous conditions.
Remote Access: View hive data remotely via a web dashboard or mobile app.
Easy Setup: Simple setup process with clear instructions.

**Installation**

Hardware Setup
Assemble the sensors and microcontroller as per the hardware requirements.
Connect the sensors to the microcontroller following the wiring diagram provided in the documentation.
Software Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-beekeeping.git
cd smart-beekeeping
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Upload the microcontroller code to your device.

**Usage**

Power on your hardware setup.
Run the main software:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Access the web dashboard at http://localhost:8000 (or your configured address) to view hive data.

**Hardware Requirements**

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
Temperature and humidity sensor (e.g., DHT22)
Bee activity sensor (e.g., microphone for audio analysis or a camera for video analysis)
Power supply
Cables and connectors

**Software Requirements**
Firebase
Python 3.x
Flask (for the web dashboard)
Additional Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Configuration
Configuration settings can be found in config.yaml. You can adjust parameters such as sensor thresholds, data logging intervals, and alert settings.
